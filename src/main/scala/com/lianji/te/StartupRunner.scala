 Spring Boot recognized that weâ€™ve autowired a DataSource dependency and automatically created one initializing the in-memory H2 data store.

@Bean tells Spring 'here is an instance of this class, please keep hold of it and give it back to me when I ask'.
Annotating@Bean only register this service as a bean(i.e a kind of Object) in spring application context. In simple word, it is just registration but nothing.

@Autowired says 'please give me an instance of this class, for example, one that I created with an @Bean annotation earlier'.
Annotating a variable with @Autowired inject a BookingService bean(i.e Object) from Spring Application Context.

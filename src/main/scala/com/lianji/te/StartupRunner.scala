 Spring Boot recognized that weâ€™ve autowired a DataSource dependency and automatically created one initializing the in-memory H2 data store.

@Bean tells Spring 'here is an instance of this class, please keep hold of it and give it back to me when I ask'.
Annotating@Bean only register this service as a bean(i.e a kind of Object) in spring application context. In simple word, it is just
registration but nothing.

@Autowired says 'please give me an instance of this class, for example, one that I created with an @Bean annotation earlier'.
Annotating a variable with @Autowired inject a BookingService bean(i.e Object) from Spring Application Context.

  @EnableScheduling is not a Spring Boot annotation, but instead is a Spring

@EnableAutoConfiguration annotations, this is a meta-annotation and internally imports
the SchedulingConfiguration via the @Import(SchedulingConfiguration.class)
instruction, which can be seen if looked found inside the code for the @EnableScheduling
annotation class.
ScheduledAnnotationBeanPostProcessor that will be created by the imported
configuration will scan the declared Spring Beans for the presence of the @Scheduled
annotations. For every annotated method without arguments, the appropriate executor
thread pool will be created. It will manage the scheduled invocation of the annotated
method
